Welcome to my 42 Piscine repository! This contains my work from the July 2023 session of the Piscine, the intense one-month coding "bootcamp" at the 42 coding school.

## About the 42 Piscine

The Piscine is a full-time, on-site program designed to develop programming skills and assess candidates for admission to the 42 coding school based on peer-to-peer learning. Participants complete various exercises and projects in C to build a foundation in coding.

## Repository Contents

    C Programming Exercises: Small functions and programs.
    UNIX Learning: Scripts and notes on UNIX basics.
    Group Projects (Rushes): Collaborative coding projects.
    Key Concepts: Functions, pointers, memory management, and adhering to coding norms.

## Goals

    Develop problem-solving skills.
    Understand fundamental C programming concepts.
    Learn UNIX system usage.
    Experience teamwork in coding projects.

This repository showcases my progress and achievements during this intense month of learning and coding. Feel free to browse and reach out with any questions!
